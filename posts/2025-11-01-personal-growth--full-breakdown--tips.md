### AI will replace tasks, not people who adapt. Be the one who adapts.

Technical skills matter, but job search strategy matters more than most boot camp graduates realize. Building projects demonstrates ability. Contributing to open source shows collaboration. Writing about your learning creates visibility. Networking with people in your target role opens doors. The developers who transition fastest treat job searching like a skill to develop, not a passive waiting game. Your learning phase should include career positioning from day one.

## Explanation
Microservices architecture breaks applications into small, independent services that communicate through APIs. Instead of one monolithic application, you build specialized services for specific functions. This enables teams to develop, deploy, and scale components independently. Microservices add complexity but provide flexibility. Understanding this architecture helps with system design and modern application development.

## Pros
Algorithmic thinking improves efficiency consciousness. Understanding time complexity and optimization makes you aware of inefficiency everywhere. You naturally seek better approaches to repetitive tasks, saving time across all activities.

## Cons
Age discrimination exists despite industry claims of meritocracy. Some companies prefer younger workers they assume are cheaper and more malleable. Career switchers over 35 sometimes face subtle bias. While skills ultimately matter more, acknowledging this challenge helps prepare for it rather than being blindsided.

## Steps
Reading technical documentation effectively (4 techniques): Start with quick start or getting started sections to understand basics. Skim the table of contents to understand what's covered before deep-diving. Follow examples by typing them yourself rather than just reading. Use search function to find specific information instead of reading linearly. Bookmark frequently needed pages. Documentation reading is skill that improves with practice and dramatically increases self-sufficiency.

## Comparison
Data engineering vs. software engineering: Data engineering focuses on pipelines, warehouses, and data quality—specialized but high-demand. Software engineering offers broader role variety but more competition. Data engineering suits people who enjoy infrastructure over features. Software engineering provides more career variety long-term.

## Tips
Bookmark useful resources in organized folders: Browser bookmarks for documentation, helpful articles, tools, and references should be organized by technology and easily accessible. Creating a well-organized knowledge base saves repeated searching. Your bookmarks become personalized reference library.

## Final Thoughts
Set up your first project repository with proper README. Even if it's just "Learning Python" with today's date. Professional habits start day one. Your future employable self will thank you.
